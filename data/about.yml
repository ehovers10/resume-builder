  I love conceptual exploration: my educational background is in philosophy and the development of formal systems. But I also love getting my hands dirty, and I'm inspired by exploring nature. I believe strongly that environmental conservation is crucial to sustainable development. Human ingenuity is expansive, but we must acknowledge its limitations and be humble enough to learn from natural systems.

  I love conceptual exploration, and my educational background is in philosophy and the development of formal systems. But I also love getting my hands dirty. I believe strongly that advancement in waste management, particularly developing strategies to implement widescale composting practices, is a vital component of a portfolio for sustainable cities. Bringing these strategies to fruition requires both creative conceptual development and elbow grease.
education: >
  I love conceptual exploration. My educational background is in philosophy and the development of formal systems. I also love applying the fruits of that exploration to practical causes and sharing my journey with others. I've taught philosophy courses at three universities and worked in the nonprofit sector, building and implementing systems to help organizations more efficiently pursue their mission and spread the word.
