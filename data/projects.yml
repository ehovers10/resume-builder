  title: Disagreement in Context
  organization: University of Wyoming
  date: May 2008
  output: "http://erikhoversten.org/research/disagreement-context-full.pdf"
  description:
    I examine the evidence for semantic relativism from discourses involving disagreement over matters of taste. Intuitively, despite having a point of genuine conflict between them, neither party to the disagreement is incorrect in their assertion. I pull out criteria that an adequate proposal for the semantics of predicates of personal taste must meet. While relativism is an adequate proposal, I argue that a contextualist proposal can also account for our intuitions. The key insight is that disagreement can be carried by pragmatic features of utterances, even if there is no semantic conflict.
