  organization: University of Wyoming
  date: May 2008

  description:
    In my Masters thesis, I examine the evidence for semantic relativism provided by discourses involving disagreement over matters of taste. Intuitively, these discourses involve faultless disagreement; despite having a point of genuine conflict between them, neither party is incorrect in their assertion. I pull out a number of criteria that an adequate proposal for the semantics of predicates of personal taste must meet. While relativism offers one adequate proposal, I argue that a contextualist proposal can also adequately account for our intuitions. The key instight is that disagreement can be carried by pragmatic features of utterances, even if there is no semantic conflict.
