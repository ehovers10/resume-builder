  I think that the abstract and the practical are mutually reinforcing. I love conceptual exploration, and my educational background is in philosophy. But I also love getting my hands dirty. I have a strong concern for the continued existence of human life on our planet, and I've become convinced that advancement in waste management is a crucial component in keeping us below 2&deg;C.
